<h1>Homemade Mozzarella Sticks</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Quick – they take about 2-3 minutes on the stove</li>
    <li>Easy – It’s literally 4 ingredients including the butter and the cheese to make a basic omelette</li>
    <li>No special tools are needed – you’ll just need a bowl, fork, small non-stick pan, and a flexible spatula for flipping.</li>
    <li>Kid-friendly – who can resist that cheese pull? We’ll sit around the table and see who can get the biggest cheese pull.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Description</h2>
<ul>
    <p><strong>There’s nothing worse than an overcooked omelette. It should be cooked until it’s just set and not browned.
        Once it’s browned, the egg deteriorates in flavor and texture. Follow these steps for moist and fluffy omelettes every time.</strong></p>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Eggs – we use large eggs, right out of the refrigerator</li>

    <li>Salt – just a pinch is plenty. We use fine sea salt which dissolves quickly.</li>

    <li>Butter – you want to keep a well-buttered skillet for each omelette. Butter adds flavor and keeps the omelette from sticking.</li>

    <li>Cheese – we love shredded mozzarella cheese (low moisture, part-skim), but you can use cheddar or your favorite cheese.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs – in a small bowl, combine 2 eggs and a pinch of salt then beat with a fork until frothy.</li>
        <p>. </p>
        <li>Heat skillet – place a small non-stick pan over medium heat and melt in 1/2 Tbsp of butter. Once butter is melted and bubbly, add beaten eggs and reduce heat to low.</li>
        <p>. </p>
        <li>Pull cooked eggs with a spatula into the center, allowing the liquid eggs to fill in the space. Watch the video tutorial above to see this process in action.</li>
        <p>. </p>
        <li>Flip – once eggs are nearly set, the omelette slides easily on the skillet and you can get a spatula underneath, flip it over. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <p>. </p>
        <li>Fold – add cheese and your favorite toppings, fold the omlette and slide it onto a plate to serve.</li>

    </ol>
</ul>
